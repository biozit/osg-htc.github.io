## Learn how to use the OSPool and OSDF

The OSG Facilitation Team supports researchers across the United States who want 
to run large computing workloads on HTC capacity like the [OSPool](services/open_science_pool). 
The team runs monthly training events and the materials from these trainings are publicly available. 

* [Upcoming Training Opportunties]()

Anyone can register and join monthly trainings - no account is needed!
