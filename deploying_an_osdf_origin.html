<p>
    Our mental model for an OSDF Origin is that of a filesystem, possibly composed of
    many servers, that is mounted on a host managed via Kubernetes. Both the filesystem
    and that host is the responsibility of the owner institution. The
    <a href="https://path-cc.io/">PATh</a> team has access
    to that host to instantiate the origin services by deploying a container.
</p>
<p>
    The institution owning the hardware on which the filesystem is implemented is
    responsible for communicating with PATh via the PATh ticketing system what parts
    of the filesystem they want to export into the OSDF, and who should have read/write
    access to it. The owner can change this unilaterally any time, but we request
    notification ideally a few days prior, if possible.
</p>
<p>
    The PATh services team is responsible for operating the origin service as requested.
    This includes communicating the absolute path the owners exported filesystems show
    up in the OSG runtime environment to the institution owning the exported filesystem.
</p>
<p>
    <a href="#figure-1">Figure 1</a> below depicts this architectural arrangement.
    PATh is responsible for services in red. This figure shows an arrangement where
    the actual exported filesystem sits behind an institutional firewall, while the
    Kubernetes host is dual homed, straddling this firewall.
</p>
<p>
    We suggest that the institution owning the filesystem and the Kubernetes host work
    with the
    <a href="https://pacificresearchplatform.org/">Pacific Research Platform (PRP)</a>
    project to operate the Kubernetes host. This
    is by far the least effort way forward for the institution. We are happy to introduce
    you.
</p>
<p>
    If the institution insists to deploy and operate the origin themselves, we can provide
    appropriate RPMs. However, we strongly suggest to leave operations of this service to
    the experts in the PATh operations team.
